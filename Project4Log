HashEntry was extremely simple to write as I've created other similar Objects so many times. I spent more time formatting the HashEntry class into JavaDoc than I spent actually writing the code for it.
For the Tokenizer class, I initially wanted to use BufferedReader to read the file, but I realized that I felt like it was simpler to just use the Scanner class. I realized both constructors needed to normalize each word, and since I would be doing this multiple times, it made more sense to create a private helper normalize method to do that task for me. I created an ArrayList in each constructor and added each word to the ArrayList after normalizing it and then finally assiging the ArrayList in the constructor to the ArrayList parameter.

It took me a bit to understand what I was supposed to be doing here for the HashTable. Once I got the concept down, implementing the HashTable was pretty easy and straightforward. In retrospect, I should have made sure I knew what I was doing before I started writing the HashTable
