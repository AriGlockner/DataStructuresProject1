10% Log (~1 hour):
Continued project 2 from where project 1 left off
Added isSorted method to NumList interface
Implemented isSorted method in NumArrayList class
Implemented toString/add/insert/size methods to NumLinkedList class

50% Log (~5 hours):
Implemented Remove/Contains/Lookup/equals/removeDuplicates/isSorted methods in NumLinkedList class
Made NumLinkedList implement Iterable and added a few helper methods meant to help Iterable interface
Adjusted toString method in NumLinkedList class to use a for each loop implementation
Changed tests for toString/add/insert/size and created tests for isSorted/contains/removeDuplicates in TestNumLinkedList class

Struggled a little with figuring out remove/removeDuplicates methods for NumLinkedList class due to NullPointerExceptions. Figured out what the problem was by creating temporary
print lines to show me where the pointer nodes were at in the list and then easily fixed the problems.
