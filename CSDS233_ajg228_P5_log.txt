This project should be very straight forward. I already wrote my own implementations of these methods using generic types, so I converted my existing code to useing ints rather than generics. All that's left is Cleaning up my code, writing test cases, benchmarking, and the extra credit

Test cases were pretty simple to write

90% Log (~1 hour):
Finished writing everything for code. Will need to write benchmarking pdf and double check code one last time
