The interface NumList felt pretty straightforward. Create a bunch of abstract methods of the names provided in the instructions pdf. Not too sure what the instructions meant by 
ordered sequence since the NumArrayList class has the add and insert methods which allows the user to break the order of the list.

I created the variables size and capacity so it's easy to compare them for figuring out if the array's size can be increased.

The constructors were very straightforward. Just initalize the capacity, size, and list.

After looking through the Java api, I found that the Arrays class has a method copyOf which can change the size of the array while keeping the current elements. That method call 
allowed me to easily create the add method when the size is less than the capacity. Figuring out what to do when the size is equal to the capacity is very unclear to me so I am 
skipping that and coming back to it later.

The toString method was very straightforward. Return "" if the list size = 0, otherwise just create a temporary string and add " " + element for each element in the list, and then 
return every character after the first character.
